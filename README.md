# Beginner-s-Snake-Game
Hi this my first project. This was made using Javascript, HTML and CSS.  <br />
I followed the [free code camp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/think-like-a-programmer-how-to-build-snake-using-only-javascript-html-and-css-7b1479c3339e/) for the basic game. I added some small changes <br />
I plan to put a start page and an end page to the code. For now I just have the basic game running.<br />
**I am new to coding so please feel free to give feedback on how I can improve my coding or on how to make this more visually interesting** <br />
I will later try to add the start and end pages. <br />
Thank you, Happy Coding!
