# Beginner-s-Snake-Game
Hi this my first project. This was made using Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
I followed the free code camp tutorial for the basic game.
I plan to put a start page and an end page to the code. 
For now I just have the basic game running.
#I am very new to coding so please feel free to give feedback on how I can improve my coding or on how to make this more visually interesting
I will later try to add the start and end page.
Thank you, Happy Coding!
